## Review of Pitch Interactive's Out of Sight, Out of Mind

[First, here's a link to the project](http://drones.pitchinteractive.com/)

This interactive web site shows each drone strike in Pakistan from 2004 to 2013. It allows the user to examine the data from the perspective attacks or victims, with a nice transition between the two views. There is a lot of data used here and some of it is represented in multiple ways.

Perhaps the most memorable element of the visualization is the way they showed each strike as a ballistic path to the timeline with a little explosion. While this is probably a pretty low data to ink ratio, I think the way they use it with the pauses and explanatory text really helps move the narrative along.

The main nominal data or labeling is done through visual variable of color and clarified through text. For instance when each victim is display (either as a block or a silhouette) they are grouped by color (children are also smaller in victim mode, but this is subtle) from bright red for children to white for high profile targets. With this choice of color scale Pitch is making a normative statement and not just using color to label the data (in this case: red is bad, white is good). However, I'm okay with it as this is not a controversial claim, e.g. even a drone strike supporter would agree with the idea that we should minimize children and civilian deaths.

This labeling scheme is then used throughout the rest of the visualization. For example across the top of the page there is a horizontal single stacked bar chart giving an overview of the entire dataset and for consistency they use the same color scale.

On the victims page along the left hand side there is an interval of dates (months) in white with the number of attacks for that month next to it in red. This is a slight deviation from the color scale combining all the attacks (even the white ones) into the red color. From a data integrity point of view this a poor move they probably should have chose a different color or none at all. However, from a graphic design perspective it looks a lot better this way, so it might not be that big of a deal, esp. since they list out each victim properly color coded further to the right on the same line.

The silhouettes while displayed are grouped by color for visual consistency, but when you hover over a particular silhouette it shows the other people that died in the same strike by fading out the others and it brings up a tool tip that shows the precise data with a little explanatory blurb.

Overall I think they did very good job presenting a lot of data in an engaging way that let the user decide the level of detail they wanted to interact with.

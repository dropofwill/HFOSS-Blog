# 3 questions for BizLeg class

For my Business and Legal Aspects of FOSS class we were asked to come up with 3 questions that we would like to hear from our classmates and post them to our blogs.

1. What's your go-to license to use for projects you make now and why? And was that different than before you took this class?

2. What's one legal case that we considered that was the most eye-opening for you?

3. Of all the business models and domains that we considered in class, which one(s) do you see your self using and which one(s) do you think will be the most effective in the near future? Of course explain what and why in some detail.

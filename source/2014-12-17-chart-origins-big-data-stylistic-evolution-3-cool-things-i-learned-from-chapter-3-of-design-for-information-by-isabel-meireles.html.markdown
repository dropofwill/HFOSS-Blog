## Chart Origins, Big Data, & Stylistic Evolution, 3 cool things I learned from Chapter 3 of Design for Information by Isabel Meireles

1. One fact that surprised me was that the Scottish Engineer, William Playfair, invented the bar, pie, and line graphs all in the late Eighteenth Century. This really drives home just how young the field of data visualization is. These basic charts are so ubiquitous now that you do not even consider that someone actually had to design them initially, much less did so within the last few centuries.

2. While designers like Playfair and Priestley did incredibly detailed and influential work, one aspect that they struggled with was scale. The data they were dealing was too large to fit into a small space, so the charts grew to several feet, to the point where the reproductions in our book are effectively unreadable. In some ways the digital age has helped us in this area, with interactivity we control the level of detail to expose to a user and allow them to step into the visualization. That said the scale of the data we're working with has also increased exponentially since the 18th century, so in a lot of ways we still face the same challenges they did.

3. I love the Barr-inspired "Diagram of Stylistic Evolution" by Ward Shelley. It clearly is the result of a vast amount of research, poured into a concise, yet expressive framework. This easily could have been created as a force directed graph digitally in a couple of hours (given the data set of course), but the result wouldn't have the same impact that this hand crafted approach does. The use of iconography and shape to portray not only the movements themselves, but their interactions with each other and the whole trend itself is really powerful. Usually I'm opposed to this sort of hand drawn approach because there is no (easy) way to generalize the approach to a different dataset. However, sometimes the result is so powerful that it is worth that domain specific work and I think this was definitely one of those cases.

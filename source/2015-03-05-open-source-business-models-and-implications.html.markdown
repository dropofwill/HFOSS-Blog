# Open Source Business Models and Implications

<insert gist>

> **Who:**, The Open Source Initiative and the Free Software Foundation
>
> **What:** Chapter 12, Section 1 of the book *Copyleft and the GNU General Public License: A Comprehensive Tutorial and Guide* and an article on the OSI's website titled *Open Source Case for Business*.
>
> **Where:** [available for free on RIT's Business and Legal issues in FOSS course website](http://bizlegfoss-ritigm.rhcloud.com/static/books/comprehensive-gpl-guide.pdf#section.12.1) and on [the OSI's website](http://opensource.org/advocacy/case_for_business.php) respectively.
>
> **When:** The OSI article was last update in 2014, but is probably much older (Netscape anyone?). First version of the FSF book was released in 2003, but has had consistent updates from then until the latest change in 2014.

## Good

* Glad to see the FSF encouraging the distribution of software in a corporate environment (even with modifications!).

## Bad

## Questions

* Does the Chapter 12 section 1 imply that one does not need to supply the source to the users if it is in a corporate environment? If so why is that considered a different form of distribution than say a download link on a website?

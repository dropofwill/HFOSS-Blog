# Blink project: Hacking on an Arduino

For my Physical Computing &amp; Alt Interfaces class we had to use an Arduino (I have the latest Uno) to control LED(s) in a non-trivial way. I knew I wanted to make some kind of LED matrix, but didn't know how big of one I could make on my half sized breadboard and limited number of pins. What I ended up with was a 16 LED (4x4) matrix controlled by just 8 pins, each of which can be individually controlled.

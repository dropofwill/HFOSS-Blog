## XO Team Proposal

### Team Members:

| Name (Handle) | Email Address |
|:--------------|:---------|
| Cole Cooper (Lynxfive) | cjc6417@rit.edu |
| Reuben Brenner-Adams (kangareuben) | rmb1952@rit.edu |
| Will Paul (dropofwill) |  whp3652@rit.edu |


### What projects did your team choose?

First choice: Puppy’s Pen (new project)
Second choice: Blocku (existing project)
2 line description of the project:

#### Puppy’s Pen:

The player has to construct an fenced area so that their dog can romp around outside. Each puzzle will give a set of criteria (area, perimeter, symmetry, angles, etc.) and ask the player to construct a pen that meets all requirements. The completion of a successful pen will result in an animation of a frolicking dog, while an unsuccessful attempt will result in the criterion or criteria not met flashing red.

#### Blocku:

Blocku is a puzzle game consisting of filling a grid with squares by matching the squares sides and following a constraint. Blocku is a game that can be used by teachers to teach a multitude of subjects to students. The teacher will be able to create a constraint such as match the formula to the answer or A + B = C. Then the teacher makes a list with two columns. Each row in the columns is a pair of of matching objects. The first row of column A matches the first row of column B. Using this formula the game will randomly assign the objects of each column to square blocks, one object per side. The student then has to put all the pieces in a grid so that pairs on the sides of the squares follow the constraint. The student will be able to move the pieces as well as rotate them.

### What will each team member’s role be?

***Cole:*** Lead artist, programmer

***Reuben:*** Project lead/manager/mentor, programmer

***Will:*** Lead programmer

### Source code repository URL:

***Puppy’s Pen:*** [kangareuben/PuppysPen](https://github.com/kangareuben/PuppysPen)

***Blocku:*** [blocku/blocku](https://gitorious.org/blocku/blocku/source/9ea360cc1d45f29ba292ae93afa7af1167c42034:)

### Commarch assessment:

***Puppy’s Pen:***

N/A.

***Blocku:***

Most of the code is in one ugly 1700-line file
No activity since 2011
Hardly any documentation
Not many commits, so probably didn’t commit often enough
Upstream mentors:


### Upstream Mentors

***Puppy’s Pen:***

| Name (Handle) | Email Address |
|:--------------|:---------|
| Remy Decausemaker (decause, remyd) | remydcsi@rit.edu |
| Ross Delinger (rossdylan) | rdelinger@helixoide.com |

***Blocku:***

| Name (Handle) | Email Address   |

| Ariel Zamparini (coolestdude1) | arielzamparini@gmail.com |
| fran | fran@dumetella.net |

### How will you communicate with them?

After class, over IRC, over email.

### What are the easy parts?

##### Puppy’s Pen

Structuring code
Designing game mechanics

##### Blocku

Finding parts of the code to refactor

### What are the hard parts?

##### Puppy’s Pen

Keeping the project’s scope under wraps
Calculating angles, area, etc.
None of us know Python particularly well

##### Blocku

Code base is basically one giant Python script, might require a bit of restructuring to understand.
Implementing the math functions where order matters (division, subtraction, modulo, etc.)
None of us know Python particularly well

### How will these be overcome?

Math is fun, so we hope we won’t hate coding it too much. We’ll use past programming knowledge to learn Python. Refactoring the Blocku code will be aesthetically and functionally rewarding. The hardest part will probably be keeping the scope in check, but we’ll regularly reevaluate necessities vs. things that would be nice.

# Open Source and Enterprise Company Profile - WebKit and Apple/Google

## The Team
Kocsen Chung
Will Paul
Andrew Schott

Presentation can be found here

## Rationale
We picked WebKit because it is a huge piece of software. The web runs the world, and the world runs on WebKit. WebKit is a huge (the biggest as of today) player in this market. It is also quite a unique culture since it is heavily tied with Apple and Kocsen worked on the WebKit team.

## Communication Channels & Community Architecture

### Channels
IRC Channel: freenode #webkit

SVN Repository Link:  http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk

Mail List Archive: webkit-help@lists.webkit.org - for general help

Blog/Website: Blog - https://www.webkit.org/blog/  Website - https://www.webkit.org/

### Community

#### History

WebKit code started in 98, with KDE HTML layout engine. After some discussions, Apple ended up announcing Safari in 2003 which used JavaScriptCore. Eventually KHTML & WebCore didn’t stay on the same page so Apple decided to fork into WebKit. Dave Hyatt announced in 2005 that Apple would open source WebKit.

#### License(s)

LGPL - JavaScriptCore & WebCore

BSD2 - Everything Else

#### Reviews Mailing Lists and The Bug review process

Apple has a very clear bug lifecycle. They use mailing lists to take care of code reviews and a lot of the communication surrounding the community.

#### Getting commit/review access

There are a total of around 250 official committers and reviewers of the webkit project. See them all here.

To be a Committer, you should follow and trust the project. A Committer gets nominated once they have around 10-20 good patches. They also have to show that they are not a potato and understand the policies and the collaboration behind the project.

To be a Reviewer you should have a very good judgement and understanding of project policies and vision. You should at least submitted 80 good patches and should be an active member of the community. 3 Reviewers must second the acceptance/nomination of a new reviewer.

You can become inactive and get committer/reviewer status revoked.

#### Getting Messy with Code

WebKit is very mature. So they do have very extensive documentation and strict code guidelines. https://www.webkit.org/coding/coding-style.html

#### Git by a bus?
WebKit is strong and huge, no bus can stop it.

#### Contributors Meeting
Each year Apple hosts a contributors meeting for the WebKit project and stakeholders. This meeting happens on Apple campus and its a way to come together and define the scope and the future of the project.

#### Overview

All in all, WebKit is a huge open source community. I would call it a very set and mature codebase. Below is a nice overview of the statistics. It has no fear of suddenly stopping and powers a lot of the web out there. It has an interesting aspect to it since a private company like Apple is behind it all but it seems to work.


#### Future and Law

What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been concerned about the development of this technology? Why?

WebKit was and is used in a number applications including

##### Currently used by:

* Apple Safari

* Blackberry’s OS

* Amazon Kindle

* And more...

* Used in the past by:

* Opera

* Google Chrome

* And more...

Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the technology? How?

Not a lot of controversy around the copyright itself, but there has been some internal conflict that lead to the Blink fork. For example: one engineer made a comment on the mailing list entitle WebKit Wishes prior to the fork that said:

> I’ve worked at both Apple and Google.  The WebKit community is full of
brilliant engineers.  Yet I frequently feel a lack of trust in my (or
others) judgement, or witness hot-headed remarks on bugs, lists or IRC.  I
don’t think it’s that people don’t trust me after nearly 8 years (!?) on
this project, but rather that we forget, or fail to communicate trust among
ourselves.  Social problems are perhaps harder to solve for us technical
types, but I worry that for many of us it’s just become “us” and “them” and
we’ve stopped trying.

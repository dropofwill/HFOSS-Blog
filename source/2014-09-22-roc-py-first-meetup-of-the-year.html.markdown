## Roc.py: First Meetup of the New School Year

I went to my first open source meetup of the school year, Roc.py! It was hosted at U of R and had a great turn out, due in no small part to the crew of pass and present HFOSSers. The meeting spanned a couple of hours and had a few announcements and lighting talks as well as a couple of featured talks, including our very own ryansb, who discussed the open courseware that runs our HFOSS class.

At the end of the meeting discussion drifted towards how to keep the meetup going, what get everyone back to the meeeting. One item that was brought up that I agree with was making the event a little more interactive, while I certainly gleaned information from the event, I could have gotten the same from browsing particular sub-reddits or lectures on Coursera. What makes a local meeting different is the interactivity and community that can arise out of it.

But how do you foster that? One method would be build the community first and out of that meetings will just become more interactive, because people are more comfortable with one another. Some people went out for drinks afterwards and that's certainly one good way to build a community (albeit a bit of an exclusive one as a number of attendees were underage no doubt). The other is to establish interactive activities as a way to build communities. One idea brought up was code reviews and group bug squashing sessions.

Beyond that comes the question of people, where are these community members going to come from? While it's true we ran out of chairs on this first meeting of the year, a large part of that group was only there because it was required for our various FOSS classes at RIT. As someone who doesn't do a whole lot of Python *development* (I do however use it quite a bit for linguistics purposes, [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/){:target="_blank"} ftw!), I wonder what the trade off is between having a specific purpose and attracting a large audience. To be honest I'm also a little jealous, why aren't there meetups like this for Ruby in the area?

All in all I still had a good time and learned a lot, esp. about OpenShift and how our HFOSS course works. (I also started a [Ruby thing](https://github.com/dropofwill/Custom-Freshbooks-Timesheets) near the end of the meeting for generating custom invoices with the Freshbooks API, as sacrilegious as that may be at a Python meetup :P.)

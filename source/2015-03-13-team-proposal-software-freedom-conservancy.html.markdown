# Team Proposal

## List your other team members below

* Andrew Schott - snapschott

* Kocsen Chung - kocsen

* Will Paul - dropofwill


## Which Entity did your team choose to profile?

Google/Apple/Opera/Adobe and WebKit/Blink

## Description of the Organization?

> Software Freedom Conservancy is a not-for-profit organization that helps promote, improve, develop, and defend Free, Libre, and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects. Conservancy provides a non-profit home and infrastructure for FLOSS projects. This allows FLOSS developers to focus on what they do best — writing and improving FLOSS for the general public — while Conservancy takes care of the projects' needs that do not relate directly to software development and documentation

## Describe each team member's role?

Stuff to do:

* Organizational details - dropofwill
* communication channels - kocsen
* community architecture -  kocsen
* service overview - snapschott

## Organization/Project Source Code Repository URL?

No source code.

## What do you anticipate the easy parts will be?

* Finding information about it, it's not a small organization.

* Collaborating on the presentation using Google Slides

## What do you anticipate the hard parts will be?

* Understanding the sources due to their legal nature.

## How will you overcome both?

Well its due Thursday, so we’ll want to have a good idea of the research/presentation by Tuesday and go over it together before the class.

## If something goes wrong, what contingencies do you have in place?

We will have the virtual power of the internet to keep a backup of all our work.

## When will your group meet regularly outside of class time?

We have a weekly @ 3pm on Wednesdays and the power of asynchronous web.

## XO Smoke Test

For HFOSS we are making Open Source games for the XO (a.k.a. One Laptop Per Child) laptops and as part of that recently received our test XO's to hack on. To make sure everything is as it should be we went through the ["Smoke Test"](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Smoke_test/10.1.x/1_hour_smoke_test){target: "_blank"} from the OLPC wiki. This is blog post serves as a reference to my run through on RIT XO LTL1.5-01.

### Start Up

Battery was already in place, so we started it up. It booted up into Gnome Desktop, becasue that's where I last used it, we switched it back to Sugar and everything seemed fine. Activity ring showed and we connected to the RIT guest network.

### Activities

Measure was doing some weird stuff at first, but we messed around with the settings and it produced a nice sine wave while whistling. It closed properly.

TamTamJam starts, we setup a few instruments in a loop, and adjusted the sound with the keyboard shortcuts.

Record starts and the webcam picture, video, and sounds inputs/playback all work properly (with the relevant lights showing per activity).

Paint starts and we drew some scribbles and shapes before closing it.

We played Memorize and messed with Music Keyboard as the other apps to mess with, everything seemed to function expected.

Journal file browser shows our drawing from Paint and all our Audo, Video, and Image from the Record activity.

### Image Transfer and Invite

Browse starts and we browsed google for red pandas, the images and documents show properly. We copied an image showed in a Frame and looked at it in the Journal. We then added it to the Write document canvas, moved it around. There weren't any XO's around to try sharing with, but I did try that in the first class session and it worked properly.

### Installing an Activity Bundle

Download Fractionauts to a USB, plugged the USB into the XO, and started it up from Journal. Search, browse, and install works.

Couldn't figure out how to install from the web, maybe I'm just a little thick or maybe it's a problem, I'll look into that later.

### Installing a Library Bundle

Went through the collections process from the library bundle section.

### Playing and .ogg File in Browse

Played a random .ogg file from Google.

### Transfer Files to USB Stick

I transferred my resume from the USB and copied the earlier activity results to the XO successfully. Unmounted, removed, and remounted the USB checking that everything.

### Collaboration with Chat

Again no XO's around at the moment, but I tried becoming friends and chatting in class and everything worked.

### Suspend/Resume Due to Cover Close

This worked fine.

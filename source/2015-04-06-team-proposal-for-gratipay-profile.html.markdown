# Team Proposal

## List your other team members below

* Andrew Schott - snapschott

* Kocsen Chung - kocsen

* Will Paul - dropofwill


## Which Entity did your team choose to profile?

[Gratipay](https://gratipay.com), the "public domain" company for sustainable crowd-funding.

## Description of the Organization?

Gratipay is a crowd-funding platform that focuses on supporting projects long-term through small, recurring payments with no-strings attached.

## Describe each team member's role?

Stuff to do:

* Organizational details - dropofwill

* Communication channels - kocsen

* Community architecture -  kocsen

* Service overview - snapschott

## Organization/Project Source Code Repository URL?

[Here's their Github](https://github.com/gratipay), all public domain.

## What do you anticipate the easy parts will be?

* Collaborating on the presentation using Google Slides

## What do you anticipate the hard parts will be?

* Finding the information we want about it, since it's a small-ish organization. That said the company is about as open as it gets, so if the info exists we should be able to find it.

## How will you overcome both?

Well its due Thursday, so weâ€™ll want to have a good idea of the research/presentation by Tuesday and go over it together before the class.

## If something goes wrong, what contingencies do you have in place?

We will have the virtual power of the internet to keep a backup of all our work.

## When will your group meet regularly outside of class time?

We have a weekly @ 3pm on Wednesdays and the power of asynchronous web.

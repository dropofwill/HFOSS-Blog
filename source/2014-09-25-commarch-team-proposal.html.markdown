## Commarch Team Proposal
For HFOSS we are reviewing the project health of the Open Source project Ruby on Rails, this is our proposal.

### Team Members:

| Name (Handle) | Email Address |
| Cole Cooper (Lynxfive)              | cjc6417@rit.edu |
| Reuben Brenner-Adams (kangareuben)  | rmb1952@rit.edu |
| Will Paul (dropofwill)              | whp3652@rit.edu |

### What project did your team choose?
Rails

### 2 line description of the project:
Rails is a Model-View-Controller web framework that is built in Ruby. It follows the mantra ‘convention over configuration’, offering reasonable defaults and scaffolding to speed up the development process.

### What will each team member’s role be?
* *Cole:* Quality assurance analyst
* *Reuben:* Lead editor and grammarist
* *Will:* Chief technical officer

### Source code repository URL:
[https://github.com/rails/rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)

### What are the easy parts?
1. Rails has excellent documentation, even from a contributor’s perspective, so finding details about the community and software should be easy.
2. One of us (dropofwill) has used Rails on quite a few projects, so this familiarity with the framework will help in the research process
3. A large community means that there are many people open to helping us with our research.

### What are the hard parts?
1. Coefficient of fail; Rails isn’t a Fedora package, so a lot of the aspects of that metric will take some effort to map to a web framework.
2. Figuring out Rails’ onboarding process for new committers may take a little effort to find.
3. Rails is divided into many packages; it may be difficult to gather data about all of them.

### How will these be overcome?
Some difficulties will be easier to surmount because of dropofwill’s familiarity with Rails. Others can be collaborated upon to avoid floundering and frustration. We’ll have to be present on the Rails IRC channel and communicate with each other fairly constantly. By 9/27, we should have a very good start on many aspects of the report; before 9/30, the project should be essentially done.

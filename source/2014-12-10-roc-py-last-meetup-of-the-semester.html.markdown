## Roc.py, Last Meetup of the Semester

This past month at Roc.py I accidentally left my computer in the trunk of my car. While being computer-less at a tech event may seem like a terrible idea it actually wasn't that bad. I found myself less likely to do homework or browse Reddit and instead focused on what everyone had to say. The only downside to this was I also didn't take any notes...and then decided to wait three or so weeks to write about it. So we'll see if that extra focused payed off in the end.

Ralph Bean gave his Module of the month talk on the [itertools module](http://threebean.org/presentations/stdlib/itertools.rst). This was probably the most applicable Roc.py talk so far for what I've been doing with Python (a lot of data manipulation, trying out more functional approaches). His explanation of the differences between iter methods and their general components (izip vs zip) and Python generators was new to me. And I ended up using product and izip in my latest NLP project after learning about them here.

There were a couple of interesting lightning talks by Alex Kyte, [msoucy](http://msoucy.me/seminars/cpy/#(1)), and [rossdylan](http://www.csh.rit.edu/~rossdylan/presentations/ConsensusAndYou/#6).

The main talk of the night was Embedding Python in a C application on a BeagleBone Black by Drew Moore. This talk built a lot on the previous framework introduced last month and since Drew has been doing this for last decade commercially, his insights were good to hear.

However, my favorite part of his talk was the intro where he spent 15-20 minutes of his talk explaining his path to Python from an electrical engineering background. I always love to hear about the pre-github generations early programming experiences, it really gives where we are now a lot of context.

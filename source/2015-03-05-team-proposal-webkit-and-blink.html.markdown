# Team Proposal

## List your other team members below

* Andrew Schott - snapschott

* Kocsen Chung - kocsen

* Will Paul - dropofwill


## Which Entity did your team choose to profile?

Google/Apple/Opera/Adobe and WebKit/Blink

## Description of the Organization?

A collection of the world’s largest tech companies working together on an open source project that has shaped the course of the web.

## Description of the project?

WebKit (and its recent fork Blink) is the open source rendering engine for a number of browsers with a significant market share. It is written in C++ and primarily licensed under the BSD 2.0 with some parts of code under an LGPL 2.1 license instead.

## Describe each team member's role?

Will divvy this stuff to do equally:

* Organizational details for each enterprise

  * Google

  * Apple

  * Adobe

  * (probably Opera)

  * (maybe KDE?)

* WebKit communication channels

* Blink communication channels

* WebKit community architecture

* Blink community architecture

* WebKit technology/product overview

* Blink technology/product overview

## Organization/Project Source Code Repository URL?

[Google’ Open Source Page](https://developers.google.com/open-source/)

[Apple's Open Source Page](https://developer.apple.com/opensource/)

[About Opera Page](http://www.opera.com/about)

[Adobe’ Open Source Page](http://www.adobe.com/open-source.html)

[WebKit Source Code](https://trac.webkit.org/browser)

## What do you anticipate the easy parts will be?

* We’re dealing with an open source project primarily involving publicly traded companies, so there is going to be no shortage of data.

* Collaborating on the presentation using Google Slides

## What do you anticipate the hard parts will be?

* Potentially too much data? Sifting through it to find the relevant and interesting parts may be challenging.

## How will you overcome both?

Well its due Thursday, so we’ll want to have a good idea of the research/presentation by Tuesday and go over it together before the class.

## If something goes wrong, what contingencies do you have in place?

We will have the virtual power of the internet to keep a backup of all our work.

## When will your group meet regularly outside of class time?

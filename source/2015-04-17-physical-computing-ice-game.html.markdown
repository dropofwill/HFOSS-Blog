For our Physical Computing class we had to come up with an Arduino game that is based around something from a given list of household items.

## Finger fencing with capacitive spandex suit and gloves

Finger fencing is the game where two people lock hands, sticking the pointer finger out. The whole point of the game is to touch some part of your opponents body to score a point. Variations exist on how many points to win, but the main problem is that it runs on honor system, and arguments often ensue about whether someone *really* touched the other. We seek to solve this problem by using the Arduino to take care of the score keeping.

The wearable aspect is pretty simple we just need to sew capacitive fabric zones onto the torso and legs of the two spandex suits. Since the whole body is covered with the spandex we just need to cut off the tip of the suits pointer finger to reveal the conductive skin.

## Other random Ideas

* LED chain of paper clips completion game

* Marco Polo with stuffed bats with sonar sensor

* Circuit City puzzle game that you make the required circuit by moving paper clips around

* Mavis Beacon games, but with a cabbage keyboard

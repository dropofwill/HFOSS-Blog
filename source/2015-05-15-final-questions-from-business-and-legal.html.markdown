# Final questions from Business and Legal

## When does code you create become copyrighted?

As soon as it is 'fixed in a tangible medium of expression', i.e. for the case of software as soon as it's saved somewhere.

## If you could wave a magic wand, and open source any piece of proprietary software, what software would you choose?

The rest of OSX, not just Darwin.

## If the software above was open sourced, would itâ€™s company remain stable? How would the company continue to make money?

Apple is fundamentally a hardware company, that's why they give away most of their software for "free" (as in price), if they open sourced their OS they would still have the same stream of revenue. Granted making a hackintosh would probably be a lot easier and would probably hurt sales slightly, but to be honest, people that would do that make up such a small part of their market I don't think it would hurt the bottom line that much.

## What do you feel like was the most beneficial thing to learn in the class?

Patent law, I knew it wasn't good for software development, but I had no idea how bad and complicated it really was.

## Explain the some of the motivations a company may have to open source software.

* Community integration and rep: people like to get involved with the products they use, especially if those people happen to be developers also.

* Free labor: if people care about your product they'll chip in for free.

* To help avoid patent trolls: a lot of startups will open source their core software, because it makes it harder for patent trolls to succeed in shutting them down.


## Are there any changes you would suggest making to the profile template?  What parts did you find most interesting or important?

I think there needs to be more emphasis on legal aspects of the projects. We touch on them a little bit in the later part of the section, but especially with Enterprise and Fiscal Sponsorship we found a lot of material that wasn't directly tied copyright law. On the other hand there was a huge lack of legal material on the startups side of things, so maybe it would be a good idea to fine tune the profiles a bit to each domain?

## If you could have spent more time, say an extra week, on any topic, which would you have liked to cover more in depth?

Definitely NDAs and employer negotiation. We really only brushed over this in the interest of guest lectures and what have you, but I think it is probably one of the most important topics. Understanding what is legal in your state or even how to figure it out is not a trivial task and even a careful reading of my NDA/NC is ambiguous as to what I'm allowed to do to this non-lawyer.

## Why are you using license **MIT** for your open source project?

I use the MIT license for most of my Ruby projects. I prefer to use 'open' licenses for interpreted languages, because I don't feel like they the advantages of 'free' licenses are necessary when the source code is the executable, plus they are simpler and easier to mix with each other. I use the MIT specifically because of community convention, MIT is the default license for gems made using the `bundler` scaffolding tool and as such a huge percentage of the community uses them as well.

## If you would suggest a video to be watched as part of this course, what would it be?

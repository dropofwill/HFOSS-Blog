# Roc.py February: Toyz for Data Reduction

No module of the month from threebean and decause was busy talking about crazy new FOSS developments at the UN, so Roc.py was a little different this time around.

Before everything got under way Chris got some discussion started about the transition between a PHP backend to Python and how to go about it. This actually stirred up quite a bit of interesting discussion, mainly revolving around the three major players in the Python space: Django, Flask, and Pyramid. The general consensus was that Django would do the most for you, but wouldn't lend itself to doing things outside the box or give you many portable skills. Flask was kind of the opposite bare bones approach, with Pyramid being the new kid on the block that people were excited about.

There were a couple lightning talks, but the main topic of the night was a new Python data visualization tool that a Grad student at U of R had been working on: *Toyz*. He called it a tool for data reduction, but really it was more of a visualization tool for astronomers who couldn't load their super-high-res photos into memory all at once, but still wanted to be able to look at the big picture. It also plotted data charts from numpy and pandas.

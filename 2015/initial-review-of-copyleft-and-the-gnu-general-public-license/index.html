    <h1>Initial Review of Copyleft and the GNU General Public License</h1>
		<p>The first chapter of a comprehensive guide to how the GPL works. This first chapter explains what free software is according to the FSF and why you should care, at a community and a global level. It uses legal jargon where necessary and definitely tries to make a point while attempting to give a non-biased view of the free software landscape.</p>

  <p><strong>What:</strong> A comprehensive (we’re talking 140+ pages) guide to how the GPL works, in particular I’ve read the first chapter on entitled <em>What is Software Freedom?</em></p>

  <p><strong>When:</strong> First version was released in 2003, but has had consistent updates from then until the latest change in 2014.</p>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Lessig’s quote about law in a free vs. closed society was a neat insight into a how lawyers think about open source. I’ve never thought about law as open source and how this effects the freedom in a society. I think this is an excellent way to introduce the concept of open source (through analogy) to someone who may be reluctant or confused about it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were promised a bit more legal-ese for this reading and while yes, there were direct references to various laws and statutes (whose verbiage itself went over my head), the text as a whole wasn’t that difficult to read.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I liked that it dove into the difficulties with Public Domain, which answered a lot of questions I’ve had with it. I looked a little further into the problem on the OSI mailing list and a lot of the problems occur in the countries of Germany, the UK, and Japan, all of which are big players in the software industry.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It puts forth the following argument against permissive licenses (particularly just releasing to the public domain, but it applies to all permissive licenses):</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>However, over time, some entities will choose to proprietarize their modified versions. The public domain body of software feeds the proprietary software. The public commons disappears, because fewer and fewer entities have an incentive to contribute back to the commons. They know that any of their competitors can proprietarize their enhancements. Over time, almost no interesting work is left in the public domain, because nearly all new work is done by proprietarization.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This is of course a good reason to use a copyleft license, <em>if this is at all a likely situation</em> for your project. A point that don’t even admit is a possibility. The FSF and the like often view the world of open source as a war zone, because of Stallman’s previous experiences in the 70s and 80s, but that does not necessarily reflect all Open Source communities that exist today. For example in the world of interpreted languages are open by default (as in binaries don’t exist, not necessarily free as in freedom) and even the biggest players in the industry open up their source code. So in cases like this the other restrictive problems that the GPL creates are more of an issue than they solve.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-questions">The Questions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Does GPL protect against future changes? I don’t see how it could. For example, Some large corporation forks a GPL’d project, but decides that they don’t want to license their particular changes as GPL, couldn’t they simply release the previous source code with the project, but keep their changes secret? If modifications are somehow protected by the GPL, what constitutes a ‘modification’, if I for instance abstracted these modifications out into a separate repo, does that make my modifications no longer a derivative work?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I still don’t really understand license compatibility. The FSF has a large list of licenses it considers compatible with the GPL, but does this mean I can fork a GPL project, make changes and release it under the simple BSD, because they are compatible licenses?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why are some FSF GPL compatible licenses not recognized as free software by the OSI? Are their approval processes more strict? I was looking at the OSI mailing list on CC0 process and it seems like they got hung up on a patent clause? I really can’t parse what the problem is though:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="final-review">Final Review</h2>

<p>It was good, but I really would be more interested getting further into the book especially the third part where they talk about real case studies and the stuff about binary distribution and patents are things that I still don’t really have a good grasp on. Overall I thought it was a better intro than the FOSS Primer simply because it went into more detail and seemed more aware of its bias, at least from this permissive license fan’s perspective.</p>

# dropofwill-blog

My blog, originally created for the HFOSS class I took in 2014, it has since expanded to include posts from 3 other classes and counting as well as other development related posts that I have on my mind. Eventually the content will be merged with dropofwill/dropofwill.github.io when I convert that into a middleman site (whenever I have time for that).

Most of the code making this run and pretty is from Middleman, SASS, and Compass, the Middleman/Middleman-Blog guides, as well as some styles from TheSassWay. All these portions are licensed as there copyright holders have decided (mostly BSD/MIT)
